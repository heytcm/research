### What is Bigu in Taoism?

Bigu (辟谷) is an ancient Taoist fasting technique deeply rooted in Chinese cultural beliefs and Taoist philosophy. Often translated as "avoiding grains" or "grain avoidance," bigu involves abstaining from grains—such as rice, wheat, and millet—and sometimes all food, with the goal of achieving physical health, spiritual purification, and even immortality. This practice has been a part of Taoist traditions for centuries but has faced modern criticism, particularly from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which views it as potentially dangerous and unscientific.

#### Origins and Meaning
The term "bigu" combines "bi" (辟), meaning "to avoid," and "gu" (谷), meaning "grain." In Taoist thought, grains were believed to feed harmful "grain-eating spirits" or "three corpses" (sanshi) within the body, which were thought to cause illness and death. By avoiding grains, practitioners aimed to starve these spirits and purify themselves. Bigu has two main forms:
- **Grain Avoidance**: Eliminating grains while consuming minimal alternatives like fruits, herbs, or nuts.
- **Complete Fasting**: Abstaining from all food, relying instead on water, qi (vital energy), or other non-food sustenance.

Historically, bigu dates back to at least the Warring States period (c. 450–300 BCE) and is referenced in classic Taoist texts like the *Zhuangzi* and *Baopuzi*. It became more prominent during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) and has been associated with Taoist immortals who were said to survive without eating or with minimal nourishment.

#### How Bigu is Practiced
Bigu varies depending on the practitioner and Taoist lineage, but common methods include:
- **Dietary Restriction**: Avoiding the "five grains" while eating small amounts of permissible foods.
- **Fasting**: Completely abstaining from food, often drinking only water, tea, or "talisman water" (water mixed with ashes of burned talismans).
- **Qi Nourishment**: Advanced practitioners replace food with qi, absorbing energy from the environment through meditation and breathing exercises.

The practice is not just about physical fasting—it’s a spiritual discipline aimed at refining the body, expelling negative influences, and aligning with the Tao, the fundamental principle of the universe.

#### Health Claims and Risks
Advocates of bigu claim it offers benefits such as:
- Detoxification of the body.
- Improved energy and metabolism.
- Enhanced mental clarity and spiritual awareness.
- Potential prevention or treatment of diseases.

However, these claims lack scientific evidence and are mostly anecdotal. Prolonged or extreme fasting can lead to serious health risks, including malnutrition, weakness, and, in rare cases, severe issues like perforation of the alimentary canal. Medical experts caution against practicing bigu without proper guidance.

#### Bigu in Modern Times
Bigu regained popularity in China during the COVID-19 pandemic as some sought alternative health practices. Social media influencers and bigu masters promoted it as a way to boost immunity and detoxify, attracting large followings. This resurgence prompted criticism from the CCP, which labeled bigu as "dangerous" and "against science," accusing some practitioners of fraud and comparing it to banned spiritual movements like Falun Gong. The CCP’s stance reflects both public health concerns and its broader suspicion of practices with religious or spiritual elements.

Globally, bigu has drawn interest among those exploring alternative health trends, though it differs from modern fasting methods like intermittent fasting due to its spiritual focus. Books like *Bigu: An Ancient Chinese Taoism Art of Achieving Good Health, Weight Loss, and Longevity* by Li Baoyou have popularized it, but they stress the importance of supervision by trained teachers.

#### Conclusion
Bigu is a fascinating blend of Taoist health and spiritual practice, with a history spanning over two millennia. While it aims to purify the body and elevate the spirit, it carries risks if practiced improperly. The CCP’s recent criticism highlights the ongoing tension between traditional practices and modern governance in China. For anyone interested in bigu, it’s essential to approach it cautiously, ideally with expert guidance, and to weigh its cultural richness against its potential health implications.
